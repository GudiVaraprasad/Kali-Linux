 <b>cp file1 file2</b> is the command which makes a copy of file1 in the current working directory and calls it file2
 
 <b>mv file1 file2</b> moves (or renames) file1 to file

You can use the <b>rmdir gudi</b> command to remove a directory names 'gudi'. (make sure that gudi is empty first). You will not be able to remove a non-empty directory.

Create a directory called 'gudi' using <b>mkdir gudi</b> and  then remove it using the <b>rmdir gudi</b> command.

 <b>clear</b> -this will clear all text and leave you with the % prompt at the top of the window. 

<b>cat randomfile.txt</b> -the command cat can be used to display the contents of a file on the screen.

<b>less randomfile.txt</b> -the command less writes the contents of a file onto the screen a page at a time. (Press the [space-bar] if you want to see another page, and type [q] if you want to quit reading. As you can see, less is used in preference to cat for long files.)

<b>head randomfile.txt</b> -the head command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen.

<b>tail randomfile.txt</b> -the tail command writes the last ten lines of a file to the screen.
